# Sign Language Detection and Translation using Python & Machine Learning (Ultralytics YOLOv8, OpenCV, Pyttsx3)

This is a sign language detection and translation model built using 
[ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
& [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)

Our pre-trained model trained on custom dataset detects sign language for the 9 following labels:
<ul>
    <li>Hello</li>
    <li>I Love You</li>
    <li>Yes</li>
    <li>No</li>
    <li>Thanks</li>
    <li>Please</li>
    <li>How</li>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>You</li>
</ul>

Based on the limited vocabulary detected, the app can construct meaningful sentences and play and audio 🔊 of the sentences constructed to the user, thereby giving voice to people with determination 💪🏻 

## A Fun Backstory
We were complete noobs at the time of building the project. When we were looking for resources to build, we couldn't literally find ANY suitable model to train/run. Most of the sign detection models were built out of Tensorflow and brother when I tell you it didn't WORK AT ALL due to dependecies error issue 😤. Yes, TF might've worked for this project in the past, but it doesn't anymore. 

Frustrated with TF we were about to ditch the project, until we finally figured out a way to build this project. That time I told myself that if this ever works out, I'm gonna make this open source such that others don't have to suffer like we did 🗿

So, here's the PyTorch file of the pretrained model. 

Have fun 😊❤️
